# BRÃ˜G App
This is the repository for Group B3 in the [DTU](https://dtu.dk) courses [02369](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02369)
and [62550](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/62550). We are developing the app for a start-up company creating
a one of a kind coffee brewer.

## Branching strategy
This will obviously evolve over time as we get more and more familiar with programming for Android applications.
With that being said though, here's something to get us started:

The `master` branch should **at all times** be production ready.
The suggested way to handle the branches is to create a new branch per feature or bug using the naming scheme `feature/awesome-new-feature`
or `bug/this-pesky bug` / `bug/issue-ref`.

Once the code is ready for production, make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request)
to the `master` branch. If there's any merging to do, please do so in your own branch to keep the master
as clean as possible at all times. In short, if you are pushing directly to the master, you are doing it wrong. :wink:
